This code is modified from the original PEGASUS implementation (http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~pegasus/). 
This code only implements the connected components algorithm from PEGASUS. 
While implementing the original algorithm, this implementation has the following changes:

1. 	The original implementation is for integral Vertex IDs. 
	This implementation is for a more generic string Vertex IDs.
2. 	This implemenation drops the summary stage at the end of the algorithm.
3. 	This implementation handles the directory cleanups more cleanly.
4. 	This implementation drops the requirement of giving the algorithm with the total number of nodes. 
	The original implementation builds a self connection for all the nodes from node-id 0 to n-1. 
	Instead, this implementation expects a self connection to be provided as input.

This is list of parameters that the implementation takes:
num_reducers=? 
edge_path=<path>
all_vertices=<path>
iteration_state=<path> 
stage1out=<path>
stage2out=<path> 
stage3out=<path> 
local_output=<path> 
grapherout=<path>
